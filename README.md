# FishWeightPrediction_LabAssignment

The project has been created as part of a Lab Assignment at Durham College.

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop a fully functional web application supported by a machine learning model. The web application is programmed in Python using the Flask framework and is deployed on the Heroku cloud platform. The application takes user input data from a fish market vendor regarding the dimensions of the fish to determine its weight for purchase.

The prediction model used in this application is a simple Linear Regression, and the dataset used to train the model is sourced from Kaggle, specifically the Fish Market dataset. The user interface and API for the application have been designed using HTML and styled with CSS. Users can input numeric values representing the dimensions of the fish and click the 'Predict' button. The pre-trained model will then use this input to predict the weight, and the output will be displayed on the screen.

## Features

- Fully functional web application for predicting fish weight based on dimensions.
- Simple Linear Regression model for prediction.
- User-friendly interface designed with HTML and CSS.

## Technologies

- Flask: Flask is a micro web framework written in Python, providing the necessary tools to develop web applications. It does not require specific tools or libraries and is lightweight.
- Python: Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language used for various purposes, including web development. Ensure you have a stable version installed on your computer before starting this project.
- Heroku: Heroku is a cloud platform that supports various programming languages, including Python. You will need an account on Heroku to deploy the application.
